As per my project, we had to create Online Hotel Management System (OHMS) for XYZ Company LTD – web application. It caters 2 kinds of users, namely – Administrator and user. OHMS is used to provide online Room and Food Services to users. Here Administrator can add/modify/delete food menu, accept/reject user’s request for food/room services. Users can register, view, book rooms, order food only if he has booked a room and then make payment for room/food charges.
