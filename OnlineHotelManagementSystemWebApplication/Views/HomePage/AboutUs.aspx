XYZHOTEL LTD. is a leader in the global hospitality industry, with a distinctive collection and a worldwide 
reputation for excellence. Our diverse portfolio includes historic icons, elegant resorts and modern 
city center properties. From the beaches of Hawaii and Bermuda to the heart of New York City, all of 
our hotels offer a superior guest experience that is uniquely "XYZ".

Hotels under the XYZ banner offer guests an extraordinary place that is created by combining unique 
architecture and structure, expressive decor and artistry, and magnificent features all in one great location.
Add great service to this and the result is an extraordinary experience that would make your memory of 
XYZ Hotels & Resorts a long and lasting one. Most of our hotels were among the first buildings to be 
erected in young cities across North America. Few hotels can boast that their communities literally grew up
around them. Today, we have added modern city center properties to our collection, with core locations that 
allow you to join the hustle and bustle of the city, take part in the action of the business district, and 
enjoy the culture, the lights and sounds of street life. Our collection includes such fine luxury resorts
as the XYZ Miramar Hotel Santa Monica, and The XYZ San Francisco, steeped in history and a city landmark. 
Our resorts are situated in some of the most breathtaking and pristine areas in the world, and travelers 
from across the globe associate XYZ with the most inviting beaches, challenging golf courses and 
exhilarating ski hills. We guarantee consistency throughout our collection of hotels and resorts by 
adhering strictly to company-wide standards. Central purchasing ensures the same high-quality amenities 
are available to all guests wherever they visit. Features such as our XYZ President's Club recognition 
program, our XYZ Gold ''hotel within a hotel'', and our Business Centers cater to the needs of 
discriminating travelers. All these and more make every XYZ hotel an extraordinary place, and your stay,
an extraordinary experience.
